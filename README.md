<h1>🌐 UIDAI Hackathon Project</h1>

A solution built for the UIDAI Data Hackathon — India’s national hackathon focused on data-driven innovation using Aadhaar datasets.

This project is a web application / analytics tool / dashboard (adjust based on what your app does) developed to extract meaningful insights from anonymised Aadhaar data and present results in a user-friendly interface.

<h2>🧠 Overview</h2>

The UIDAI Data Hackathon invites participants to explore patterns, trends, anomalies, and predictive signals hidden in Aadhaar enrolment and update datasets, and build tools or visualizations that support informed decision-making and system improvements.

This repository contains the full stack source code of our hackathon entry.

<h2>📌 Features</h2>

1. 🔍 Data Analysis & Visualization – Interactive charts and graphs to explore Aadhaar trends.

2. 📊 Dashboard Interface – Clean UI to present key insights.

3. 🚀 Responsive Design – Works across devices.

4. 🔐 (Optional) Authentication or secure routes if applicable.

5. 🛠 Modular architecture using components and hooks.
